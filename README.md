## About

Cinemax is a web application that allows users to browse movies, log in or register, and make bookings. Additionally, there's an admin panel where admins are notified of new bookings and can either accept or decline them. Both user and admin interfaces support basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.


## Interfaces

- User
- Worker
- Admin


## Technologies Used

- PHP
- HTML, CSS
- Bootstrap, W3CSS
- JavaScript
- MySQL
- XAMPP



## What I've Learned

After completing the Cinemax website, I've learned how to design and implement a user-friendly, mobile-responsive interface. I gained experience in using PHP to add functionality, including implementing CRUD operations and handling authorization between user roles.
